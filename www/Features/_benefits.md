### What kingdom value does this app instill in the life of the user?

We were not made to be weak.
Weaknesses are not a part of our character. 
We can overcome them through wise decisions.
We should not see our weaknesses as part of who we are, 
but rather as a temporary shortfall that was not designed in us.


## Lifetime Benefit
### How does this app transform the user's life?

Master the spelling of any word without fear.
We will no longer be embarassed about our spelling abilities.
We will stop saying, "I'm a terrible speller."
Instead, we will know how to spell every useful word.


## Emotional Benefit

We will feel confident in our spelling abilities instead of ashamed.

### How does this app fulfill what the user really wants?

It will demonstrate to them that they can quickly learn 
how to spell words which have always been a struggle.

### How does this app fulfill the user's expectations the very first run?

1. Identify the user's level (through adaptive questions)

Have a tree of words that get increasingly difficult. 
As the user correctly spells the words, increase the difficulty
in both word groups and problem mode.

"Which word is spelled right?"
	- "you will definitely conquer misspellings acquiring indispensable intelligence conscientiously exhilerating"
		- LEVEL 10
	- "yu kan spel"
		- LEVEL 0

2. Give the user practice with those words:
	- Most common Phonetic words
	- Sight words
	- Most common words
	- Most commonly misspelled words
